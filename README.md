# Snake-Game
This project is a multiplayer version of the classic Nokia Snake game, developed using programming fundamentals with a focus on dynamic memory management via pointers. The game grid is managed using pointers, allowing for efficient handling of the snake's movement and growth. Players can compete while collecting life potions and time-based bonus potions, which increase the snake's length, adding a competitive edge to the gameplay. This project demonstrates key concepts such as pointer manipulation, dynamic memory allocation, and multiplayer game mechanics.
